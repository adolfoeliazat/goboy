# GoBoy

GoBoy is a multi-platform Nintendo GameBoy and GameBoy Color emulator written in go.
This emulator was primarily built as a development exercise, and while still 
work in progress it should run the majority of GB games, and some CGB games. There is also experimental
sound and colour support implemented.

The program includes debugging functions which make it useful for understanding how the emulator is working or
for building one yourself, such as a method for printing out opcodes and register values to the console at each
step. Turning these on will slow down the emulation.

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/Humpheh/goboy
```

The program has been tested on MacOS and Windows 10, and is likely to work on Linux. Building on Windows 10
requires MinGW (I recommend [msys2](http://www.msys2.org/)).

GoBoy uses pixel for control binding and graphics rendering. This requires the installation of OpenGL. Instructions on
installing them can be found on the [pixels readme](https://github.com/faiface/pixel#requirements).

## Usage 
```sh
goboy -sound -cgb -rom zelda.gb
```
Controls: <kbd>&larr;</kbd> <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> <kbd>&darr;</kbd> <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> <kbd>Backspace</kbd>

The colour palette can be cycled with <kbd>=</kbd> (in DMG mode).


Other options:
```sh
  -cgb
    	set to enable cgb mode
  -cpuprofile string
    	write cpu profile to file
  -disableVsync
    	set to disable vsync
  -rom string
    	location of rom file (required)
  -sound
    	set to enable sound emulation (experimental)
```

### Debugging
There are a few keyboard shortcuts useful for debugging: 

<kbd>Q</kbd> - force toggle background<br/>
<kbd>W</kbd> - force toggle sprites<br/>
<kbd>A</kbd> - print gb background palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>S</kbd> - print sprite palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>E</kbd> - toggle opcode printing to console (will slow down execution)<br/>
<kbd>7,8,9,0</kbd> - toggle sound channels 1 through 4.

### Saving 
If the loaded rom supports a battery a `<rom-name>.sav` (e.g. `zelda.gb.sav`) file will be created
next to the loaded rom containing a dump of the RAM from the cartridge. A loop in the program will
update this save file every second while the game is running.

## Testing
GoBoy currently passes all of the tests in Blargg's cpu_instrs test rom.

This rom is included in the source code along with a test to check the output is as expected (`instructions_test.go`).
